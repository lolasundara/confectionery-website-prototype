        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our journey begins thousands of years ago in the rainforests of Central America, where ancient tribes discovered the power of the <strong>mighty cocoa bean</strong>.</p>
        <p>It continues through centuries, when it was embraced by Coco's great Choco family, who opened their own cocoa houses and chocolate shop.</p>
